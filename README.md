### Project Title
Exploration of Bikeshare data using python

## Description
This project satisfies the requirements of the Udacity Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree Program which includes python and git for version control.

The program included utilizes user inputs on a terminal to run a simple analysis on bikeshare data from three US cities: Washington, Chicago, and New York City.

The user is able to filter the data by city, month, and day if they desire.  
The results returned by the program include:
most popular month
most popular day
most popular hour
most popular start and end stations
most popular route
average trip duration
type of user
number by gender (not available for all cities)
oldest and youngest user (not available for all cities)
the ability to choose how much raw data to view
the ability to restart the program

### Files used
The program utilizes python, pandas, and numpy.
The bikeshare csv files were provided by Udacity.
